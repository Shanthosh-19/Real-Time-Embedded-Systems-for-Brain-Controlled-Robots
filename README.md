# Real-Time-Embedded-Systems-for-Brain-Controlled-Robots
This is the project that, I developed during my Internship at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli in the Dept. of Computer Science under Dr. Shameedha Begum, Assistant Professor at the Dept. of Computer Science.
I thank Dr. Shameedha Begum and Mr. Kannadhasan for guiding me throughout the internship.
