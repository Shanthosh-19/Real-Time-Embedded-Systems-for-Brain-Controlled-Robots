# Real-Time-Embedded-Systems-for-Brain-Controlled-Robots
This is the project that, I developed during my Internship at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli in the Dept. of Computer Science under Dr. Shameedha Begum, Assistant Professor at the Dept. of Computer Science.
The objective of this project is to collect Brainwave signal from the Neurosky device and based on the "frequency of the EEG signals", the TGAM - ASIC module present inside the device will output the digital values to work with digital devices. Here, we have used this signal to control robot with the "Attention and Meditation signals" that we get through the device. Also, we can achieve the control of various objects which can help people.
I thank Dr. Shameedha Begum and Mr. Kannadhasan for guiding me throughout the internship.
